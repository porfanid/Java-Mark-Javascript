## About this project
This project is a web app designed to calculate the grade for the course of ΜΥΥ205 ΤΕΧΝΙΚΕΣ ΑΝΤΙΚΕΙΜΕΝΟΣΤΡΕΦΟΥΣ ΠΡΟΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΙΣΜΟΥ at the [University of Ioannina](https://www.uoi.gr) by utilizing the pdf file that can be found [here](https://ecourse.uoi.gr/mod/resource/view.php?id=52069) at page 5.

## Why I created this project
Many fellow students kept asking me how much they should score at the end of the semester exams, in order to pass the class.
https://github.com/porfanid/Java-Mark-C-Sharp
So I thought that I could make everyone's life easier by creating this app that could calculate the marrk automatically. So, what we actually win is:
- no need for late night phone calls to ask what our grades are going to be
- Easy calculation without any doubt and you can see the mark you should write right in front of you

This project is designed to continue the previous one written in c# and uploaded to microsoft store, as I wanted to make this app cross platform.
